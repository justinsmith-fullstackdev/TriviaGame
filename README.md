### How the Trivia Game Works

- A trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

- If the player selects the correct answer, a screen will show congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, display the next question

- The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

  - If the player runs out of time,their will be a notification showing that time's up and the correct answer will be displayed before the next question.
  - If the player chooses the wrong answer, the game will tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer before showing the next question.

- On the final screen, the number of correct answers , incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game will show(without reloading the page).
